Helm is a package manager for Kubernetes 
that simplifies the deployment and management of applications within a Kubernetes cluster. 
It uses Helm Charts, which are collections of files describing a set of Kubernetes resources, to automate the deployment and configuration of applications.

Key Uses of Helm in Kubernetes:

	1.	Application Deployment:
Helm charts provide pre-configured templates for deploying complex applications or services, eliminating the need to manually write YAML files for each Kubernetes resource.
	2.	Version Control:
Helm allows you to version your deployments, making it easy to roll back to previous versions in case of an issue.
	3.	Customization with Values:
Helm charts support parameterized configurations through values.yaml files. Users can override these values to customize the deployment without modifying the templates.
	4.	Dependency Management:
Helm helps manage dependencies between charts, ensuring that required components (like databases or caches) are installed and configured correctly.
	5.	Easier Updates:
With Helm, you can easily update applications by upgrading the chart version or modifying configuration values.
	6.	Simplified Sharing:
Helm charts can be stored in repositories, making it easy to share and distribute standardized deployments across teams or organizations.

Common Helm Commands:

	•	helm install — Deploys an application to a Kubernetes cluster.
	•	helm upgrade — Updates an existing deployment.
	•	helm rollback — Rolls back a deployment to a previous version.
	•	helm list — Lists all the deployed charts in the cluster.
	•	helm repo — Manages Helm chart repositories.

Use Cases:

	•	Deploying complex applications like databases, web servers, or monitoring tools (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana).
	•	Standardizing application deployments across environments (development, staging, production).
	•	Automating infrastructure as code (IaC) practices for Kubernetes.

Helm simplifies Kubernetes operations and is widely used in production environments for managing scalable, repeatable deployments.
